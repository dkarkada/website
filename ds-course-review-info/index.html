                    This webapp is meant to allow Dean's Scholars to read and write course reviews for classes they've taken. This information is stored in a publicly available spreadsheet; the app can read from the spreadsheet without any permissions. However, for some reason, in order to write to the spreadsheet (i.e. submit a review), I need to ask you to sign in to Google.</p>
                <p>
                    Although the app asks to access your spreadsheets, this is only because this is the permission that the Google API requires. The app doesn't actually look at your spreadsheets at all. The app is just writing to the public course review spreadsheet.
                </p>
                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>
                    The DS Course Reviews app does not read, modify, or use your user data in any way. The app's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
